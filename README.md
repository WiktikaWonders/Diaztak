Learning scripting and code via chewing on 7d2d amazing customization abilities.

I have zero talent in creating anything from scratch (including my children hehahehm), so I tend to work backwards by chewing on other peoples work. I have created nothing here aside from a compilation of other peoples extremely hard work. If you see your mod, tools, or script here please know it is not for me to claim as my own, simply one I favor and keep close. 

Oh and by the way, those whose work is here or mentioned - thank you for being such awesome teachers!
